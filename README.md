# COMP3421/9415 Computer Graphics Project

This repo contains the code, assets, and any other necessary files for the term-long COMP3421/9415 Project.

The project spec can be found [here](https://moodle.telt.unsw.edu.au/mod/resource/view.php?id=5035066).

You may modify this repo in any way you and your team see fit so long as the below considerations are met.

## Repo Size !! Important !!

Unreal Engine/Unity assets can quickly become very large. Therefore:
- You **MUST** ensure your project repo is no larger than 2GB.

Ways to reduce repo size:
- You can use a compression tool like 7zip to zip your project folder and upload it here
- You can provide custom instructions on how to acquire the resources you are using and only upload code here (see the section on "Custom Set-Up")

If, after following the above tips, this repo is still very large, you can zip your project and upload the archive to your UNSW OneDrive account and simply link to it from here.

## Custom Set-Up

If your project has any special or otherwise non-obvious set-up that needs to be done before your project can be built, please edit the provided SETUP.md file.

You can put any instructions here for your tutor, including how to download any assets or where to fetch a zipped-up version of your repo if it is too large for Gitlab.
